                He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic 
                election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism 
                and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, 
                he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

                  with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that
